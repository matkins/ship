    <h3>Sheffield Health and Social Care (SHSC) NHS Foundation Trust Partnership with Mental Health Services in Gulu, Northern Uganda.</h3>
    <blockquote>&ldquo;Global mental health is an interdisciplinary field which draws its primary inspiration from global health, where the main goal is equity in health outcomes, both within and between populations. The principles of global mental health are, therefore, as applicable in the developed world as in the developing world&rdquo;

    <p><img class='img-responsive' src="img/gulu/44fc6db4.png"/></p>
    <p>The Sheffield-Gulu mental health link is a multi-sector partnership that encompasses statutory, voluntary and private organisations in both the UK and Gulu- working towards the agreed aim of improving mental health support for people in both cities. This innovative partnership recognises the strengths that each partner can contribute to the above aim and that working together provides strength of purpose, improved focus, greater flexibility and ensures both accountability and sustainability.</p>
    <p>The following statement was signed by the Head of the Gulu Regional Referral Hospital (GRRH) Mental Health Unit, the SHSC Partnership Coordinator, and Clinical Lead in Sheffield on 23 August 2013. This statement underpins the work of the Partnership.</p>

    <h4> 2. Background and Context</h4>
    <p><strong>A. Uganda.</strong> Uganda is a low income country with an estimated population of 37 million, with a growth rate of 3% per annum, and 50% of the population are under 15 years. </p>
    <p>It is a country with one of the highest rates of death rates from Malaria in Africa and its mental health resources have to compete for funding with disease killers such as this and others. The nations commitment to and success in tackling Malaria can be judged from figures which show that in 2001 only 1% of children were treated within 24 hours of contracting the disease, and in 2011 this had risen to 48%. Uganda is on track to meet the United Nations Millennium Goal in this area.</p>
    <p>However it spends only 0.7% of its health budget on mental health services compared to 10% in the UK (WHO mental health Atlas 2005). However the UK does not have the same disease burden of Malaria and other conditions as Uganda. Rates of mental health problems are high with Anxiety at 20-62%, Depression at 12-68% (depending upon the areas of the country- indicating a high level of geographical difference) and alcohol dependency at 14% in the general population (Mental Health Policy 2007)</p>
    <p>Mental health is recognised in the Ugandan Governments Health Strategy (National Minimum Health Care Package Ugandan Health Sector Quality Improvement Plan 2010-2011to 2014-15), which sets out the expected performance standards in the provision of mental health, from national through regional to district and village level. Guiding principles of the Mental Health Policy (2007) include decentralization of services from national hospital into the community, integration of mental health services into the primary care system and community participation</p>
    <p>There are fewer than 40 Psychiatrists in Uganda, mainly based in the capital, Kampala (Kigozi 2005).</p>
    <p><img class='img-responsive' src="img/gulu/m3694b3a9.jpg"/></p>
    <p><strong>B. Northern Uganda.</strong> Northern Uganda is a post conflict region recovering from the devastating effects of the terror campaign of the Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army (LRA) over 25 years. Mental health problems include very high rates of Anxiety, Depression, Post Traumatic Disorder and increasing incidences of completed suicides. Work from Professor Ovuga at Gulu University comparing rates of these conditions in Northern Uganda with other areas in the country found significantly higher incidences in the post conflict region.</p>
    <p>As well as the recognised effects of collective trauma in post conflict communities, a particular feature of this was the impact upon children- many of whom were abducted and forced to become child soldiers or sex slaves. Many of the surviving children are now of child bearing age and the long term impact of the mental health of both the individuals and the community is very clear.</p>
    <p>These former child soldiers and the children of the forced marriages between abducted girls and the LRA Commanders are often unable to integrate into mainstream society as they are largely shunned by communities and have little if any access to land, education or other opportunities.</p>
    <p>Research by Dr. James Okello, a Psychiatrist employed at Gulu University, indicates that 71% of adolescents in Gulu suffer from psychiatric disorders. </p>
    <p>The communities and the Government have identified mental health as a priority in the process of rebuilding communal structures and regeneration.</p>
    <p><strong>C. Gulu.</strong> Gulu Regional Referral Hospital (GRRH) was built in the 1930&rsquo;s by the British Colonial Administration. Run by the Ugandan Ministry of Health it has 12 wards and a range of Outpatient services. As a Regional Mental Health Unit it offers an Inpatient and Outpatient service to people in Northern Uganda and Southern Sudan. The Mental Health Unit is a 40 bedded unit and often has 50-80 people queuing on a daily basis for Outpatient appointments.</p>
    <p>Significant building developments are currently underway at GRRH in several areas of medicine. This work is largely funded by foreign donors. The issue of mental health stigma, which is a global phenomenon, makes this less popular amongst donors. </p>
    <p>The Gulu Sheffield Mental Health Partnership Plan dovetails with the major priorities of Gulu Hospital for the year 2013, which are concerned with improving the quality and care of patients. </p>
    <p>The Unit is staffed by Psychiatric Clinical Officers, Nurses, and Mental Attendants on a 24 hour basis and all are employed by the Hospital through the Ministry of Health.</p>
    <p>Two Non- Governmental Organisations (NGO&rsquo;s) also provide services into the Mental Health Unit. These are:</p>
    <ul>

    <h4>4. The Work</h4>
    <p><strong>A. Patient Safety at GRRH</strong></p>
    <p>The initial 3 year phase prioritises Patient Safety as the central element of the work. Patient Safety is also a current priority of Gulu Regional Referral Hospital (GRRH) and SHSC is working with GRRH to address this by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Providing training in the prevention and management of violence and aggression (RESPECT &ndash;which is the SHSC preferred technique and is widely used in the UK) to Unit staff. This has been requested by Gulu staff. The Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Trust has received funding of £73,000 over 20 months to provide a Training of Trainers programme for Gulu Hospital staff to teach RESPECT techniques. The training provided will be to other staff at Gulu Hospital and is aimed at providing an ethical approach to the prevention and management of violence and aggression.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Enabling GRRH staff to visit Sheffield on a Commonwealth Fellowship programme aimed at furthering the two way learning process and cementing understandings between the partners. By the end of 2015 18 GRRH staff will have visited Sheffield for 8 week programme&rsquo;s. These visits have produced Project Plans that have become the core of the work with GRRH. They include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Leadership and Management</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Staff Training programme</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Handover of information between shifts. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Occupational Therapy</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Discharge planning</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Information system- enabling monitoring and evaluation to be undertaken</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Infection Control</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Library and Learning Centre</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Patient support in the community</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Mental Health Uganda- see below for details</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Supporting the development of an Occupational Therapy (OT) service on the Mental Health Unit at GRRH. A concrete Tortoise has recently been constructed outside the Mental Health Unit to symbolise the process of Recovery. This structure, which mirrors the tortoise outside one of the SHSC Inpatient sites, was funded by Creative Potters, a service user group in Sheffield.</p>
    </li>

    <p><img class='img-responsive' src="img/gulu/37a225d.jpg"/></p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Supporting Gulu partners to open a Children&rsquo;s Ward on the Mental Health Unit in GRRH, funded by staff donations through SHIP. This dedicated ward is important as it allows the children, with their particular needs, to be cared for safely in a separate room away from the adults. A welcoming and safe environment will be matched by specialist care. </p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>There are similarities and differences in the medication in use in the UK and the doses and routes of administration that our partners prescribe. Some of the differences have patient safety implications, which are being addressed through training, the development of shared protocols and the provision of equipment. It is important, as with all of the partnership work, to view this in a cultural, resource and environmental context. </p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Acute Illness Management Training (AIM&rsquo;s) </p>
    <p><img class='img-responsive' src="img/gulu/af14332.jpg"/></p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Brokering the provision of capital investment in the infrastructure of the Unit building from individual donors, SHIP and the Rotary Club in Gulu </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>In collaboration with Gulu Hospital the partnership has recently funded the refurbishment of a borehole enabling running water to available in both the Maternity and Mental Health Units</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>B. Working with Mental Health Uganda (MHU) in Gulu. This work involves:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Mental Health Awareness training- that enables MHU members to provide structured support to others. Piloted using Health Uganda Group Sheffield members, MHU members are being trained by SHSC to deliver Mental Health Awareness training in the Gulu area. Work in Epilepsy and Seizure Awareness is also starting in communities. This work is currently funded by staff donations through SHIP</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mental Health Uganda MHA Training</p>
    <p><img class='img-responsive' src="img/gulu/1dd7a24d.jpg"/></p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Capacity building by funding bicycles for the group to enable an expansion of their support work. This was achieved by a donation of US$1000 from the Board of SHSC. Governance arrangements identify accountability and maintenance measures are in place.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img class='img-responsive' src="img/gulu/m546573fd.jpg"/></p>
    <p><img class='img-responsive' src="img/gulu/6507fa6.jpg"/></p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Investment in livelihood projects that enables MHU members (all of whom have/ currently are experiencing mental health problems) to undertake income generation projects thereby reducing the pressures on their mental health. SHSC staff contributions, through Gulu Gifts, have funded the purchase of three herds of goats for MHU, which have been donated to members of the group in most need. The offspring of these goats will be handed onto other members of the group, and this self- sustaining process will continue- entirely managed by MHU. This will provide modest income generation and a focus for daily living for those with mental health problems in the community</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
