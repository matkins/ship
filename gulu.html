    <h2>Sheffield Health and Social Care
    (SHSC) NHS Foundation Trust Partnership with Mental Health Services in
    Gulu, Northern Uganda</h2>
    
    <h4>1. Sheffield Gulu Mental Health Partnership: Description, Mission Statement and Principles</h4>

    <p>The UK Department of Health supports the
    development of International Health Links in the NHS and this is supported
    by the Department for International Development (DfID). The Ministry of
    Health estimates that the majority of NHS Trusts have International Health
    Links.</p>


    <p>The Board of Directors of the Sheffield
    Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust receive an Annual Report from
    the Partnership and:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Offer their full
        support</li>

        <li>Endorse initiatives that
        offer staff opportunities to support the partnership, both financially
        and in other forms of commitment</li>

        <li>Wish to transfer learning
        from the Partnership into the Sheffield context</li>

        <li>Have made personal
        donations to support the work with Mental Health Uganda</li>
    </ul>


    <p>The Chairman and Chief Executive have agreed
    that no NHS commissioned finance will be used to support the partnership,
    but other means of financial assistance will be encouraged. Such financial
    support includes the creation of an independent charity (SHIP) , Gulu Gifts
    (a catalogue of items that staff can purchase that supports the
    Partnership), Payroll Giving, and applications to external funding
    agencies.</p>


    <p>The Sheffield Health International
    Partnerships (SHIP) is an independent charity chaired by Professor Chris
    Bentley and with Trustees including the SHSC Chief Executive; SHSC Director
    of Commercial Relations; the SHSC Partnership Coordinator and Clinical
    Lead; the Chief Financial Officer for the Sheffield Hospitals Charitable
    Trust; the UNISON Sheffield Convenor; two Sheffield GP’s and the Chair of
    the Uganda Diaspora group in Sheffield</p>


    <p>The SHSC Trusts Chief Operating Officer/
    Chief Nurse is the Executive Lead for the Partnership</p>

    <p>The Sheffield-Gulu mental health link is a
    multi-sector partnership that encompasses statutory, voluntary and private
    organisations in both the UK and Gulu- working towards the agreed aim of
    improving mental health support for people in both cities. This innovative
    partnership recognises the strengths that each partner can contribute to
    the above aim and that working together provides strength of purpose,
    improved focus, greater flexibility and ensures both accountability and
    sustainability.</p>


    <p>The following statement was signed by the
    new Head of the Gulu Regional Referral Hospital (GRRH) Mental Health Ward,
    his Deputy, the SHSC Partnership Coordinator, and Clinical Lead in
    Sheffield on 23 August 2013. This statement underpins the work of the
    Partnership.</p>


    <p>“We agree to work together in Partnership to
    improve the support and services to people with mental health problems in
    Gulu and Sheffield. We will do this by:</p>


    <ul>
        <li>Having a commitment to joint
        learning.</li>

        <li>Exchange visits.</li>

        <li>Regular communication by e-mail and
        Skype between visits to Gulu and Sheffield.</li>

        <li>Working with other appropriate
        partners.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>The Principles of the Partnership
    are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Honesty, Transparency and
        Reliability.</li>

        <li>Respecting each other’s cultures and
        customs.</li>

        <li>Empowering each other.</li>

        <li>Commitment to a common
        cause.</li>

        <li>Accountability to each
        other.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Background and Context</h4>

    <p>Uganda is a low income country with an
    estimated population of 34.7 million. It is a country with one of th
    highest rates of death rates from Malaria in Africa and its mental health
    resources have to compete for funding with disease killers such as this and
    others. The nations commitment to and success in tackling Malaria can be
    judger from figures which show that in 2001 only 1% of children were
    treated within 24 hours of contracting the disease, and in 2011 this had
    risen to 48%.</p>

    <p>However it spends only 0.7% of its health
    budget on mental health services compared to 10% in the UK (WHO mental
    health Atlas 2005). However the UK does not have the same disease burden of
    Malaria and other conditions as Uganda. Rates of mental health problems are
    high with Anxiety at 20-62%, Depression at 12-68% (depending upon the areas
    of the country- indicating a high level of geographical difference) and
    alcohol dependency at 14% in the general population (Mental Health Policy
    2007)</p>


    <p>Mental health is recognised in the Ugandan
    Governments Health Strategy (National Minimum Health Care Package Ugandan
    Health Sector Strategic Plan 2005) which sets out the expected performance
    standards in the provision of mental health, from national through regional
    to district and village level. Guiding principles of the Mental Health
    Policy (2007) include decentralization of services from national hospital
    into the community, integration of mental health services into the primary
    care system and community participation</p>

    <p>There are fewer than 40 Psychiatrists in
    Uganda, mainly based in the capital, Kampala (Kigoz1 2005).</p>


    <p>Northern Uganda is a post conflict region
    recovering from the devastating effects of the terror campaign of the
    Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) over 25 years. Mental health problems include
    very high rates of Anxiety, Depression, Post Traumatic Disorder and
    increasing incidences of completed suicides. Work from Professor Ovuga at
    Gulu University comparing rates of these conditions in Northern Uganda with
    other areas in the country found significantly higher incidences in the
    post conflict region.</p>


    <p>As well as the recognised effects of
    collective trauma in post conflict communities, a particular feature of
    this was the impact upon children- many of whom were abducted and forced to
    become child soldiers or sex slaves. Many of the surviving children are now
    of child bearing age and the long term impact of the mental health of both
    the individuals and the community is unclear.</p>

    <p>These former child soldiers and the children
    of the forced marriages between abducted girls and the LRA Commanders are
    often unable to integrate into mainstream society as they are largely
    shunned by communities and have little if any access to land, education or
    other opportunities.</p>

    <p>Research by Dr. James Akello, a Psychiatrist
    employed at Gulu University, indicates that 71% of adolescents in Gulu
    suffer from psychiatric disorders.</p>


    <p>The communities and the Government have
    identified mental health as a priority in the process of rebuilding
    communal structures and regeneration.</p>

    <p>The Sheffield Gulu Mental Health Partnership
    Development Plan dovetails with the major priorities of Gulu Hospital for
    the year 2013, which are concerned with improving the quality and care of
    patients. These are approved by the Ugandan Ministry of Health.</p>


    <p>Gulu Regional Referral Hospital (GRRH) was
    built in the 1930’s by the British Colonial Administration. Run by the
    Ugandan Ministry of Health it has 12 wards and significant Outpatient
    services. The Mental Health Ward is a 40 bedded unit and often has 50-80
    people queuing on a daily basis for Outpatient appointments. It was opened
    in 2004 but was unfortunately built to a specification that was not fit for
    purpose. The internal environment is not suitable for an Acute Psychiatric
    setting as the fixtures and fittings are of a household quality. This is
    not appropriate for the sometimes challenging environment of a Mental
    Health Ward and predictably this has resulted in the creation of a Ward
    that is in a poor condition and unhygienic.</p>

    <p>Food is not provided by the Hospital
    authorities due to budgetary constraints and patients are fed by family
    members, known as Attendants. Medication is also sometimes not available
    due to logistical issues and budgetary constraints</p>

    <p>Significant building developments are
    currently underway at GRRH in several areas of medicine. This work is
    largely funded by foreign donors. The issue of mental health stigma, which
    is a global phenomenon, makes this less popular amongst donors, hence the
    lack of progress in redeveloping this ward. &nbsp;</p>


    <p>The Ward is staffed by Psychiatric Clinical
    Officers, Nurses, and Mental Attendants on a 24 hour basis and all are
    employed by the Hospital through the Ministry of Health.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;As a Regional Mental Health Ward it
    offers an Inpatient and Outpatient service to people in Northern Uganda and
    in some cases Southern Sudan. &nbsp;</p>

    <p>The Ward will continue to provide this
    service regardless of the success or otherwise of efforts to improve the
    environment for patients</p>
    
    <h4>3. Sheffield Gulu Mental Health Partnership: The Partners</h4>
    
    <p>Sheffield Health and
    Social Care NHS Foundation Trust<span class=
    "c1">&nbsp;(SHSC) as the lead partner in the Sheffield-Gulu
    Mental Health Partnership takes responsibility for
    coordinating and delivering the Strategic Plan that has
    been agreed between all of the above partners. In that role
    it:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>project
        manages funds raised within the UK;</li>

        <li>provides
        training and staff development opportunities in Uganda
        and the UK as agreed with partners;</li>

        <li>provides a
        brokerage service &nbsp;between the different groups in
        the partnership- including private sector and
        individual funders;</li>

        <li>ensures that
        appropriate monitoring and evaluation techniques
        measures the impact that the efforts of the partnership
        is making to the lives of the people in Northern Uganda
        with mental health problems &nbsp;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b><u>Uganda Partners</u></b></p>

    <p><b>Mental Health Uganda</b> is the main service
    user group working in Gulu area. This Voluntary sector
    group has approximately 50 active members who provide
    support to individuals with mental health problems both in
    Gulu town and the surrounding rural communities.</p>


    <p><b>Gulu Regional Referral Hospital</b> (GRRH) is
    the provider of state run Inpatient mental health services
    in the Gulu area and as such is the one of the main
    vehicles in Northern Uganda for achieving a change in the
    services and support offered to people in the region.
    Inpatient and Outpatient services are offered both within
    the hospital and in District Health Centres.</p>

    <p><b>Gulu University</b> provides training
    for Medical staff and employs Doctors-some of whom work on
    the mental health ward of the hospital. Professor Ovuga,
    has been a major influence in mental health in
    Uganda.</p>

    <p><b>Uganda Ministry of Health</b> as the national body
    tasked with providing health services in Uganda are vital
    partners in this plan. Dr. Sheila Ndyanabanangi, the
    Principal Medical Officer for Mental Health, has given it
    her full approval and asked for regular reports on the
    progress of the Development Plan in Gulu</p>

    <p><b><u>UK Partners</u></b></p>

    <p><b>University Hospital of South Manchester</b> (UHSM) has
    been the main UK partner for SHSC &nbsp;and is supporting
    the development of the mental health partnership by
    offering its infrastructure arrangements (e.g.
    accommodation and transport as well advice and support in
    the implementation of the Development Plan. The
    Gulu-Manchester partnership model, which focuses on
    physical health provision and training, has clearly
    produced identifiable results and there is agreement that
    this will provide the basis for the Sheffield link-albeit
    amended to reflect the needs of the mental health
    community.</p>


    <p><b>Sheffield Teaching Hospitals</b> (STH) provide essential
    Epilepsy training into the Gulu Commonwealth Fellowship
    visitors programme. Epilepsy is included in the mental
    health field in Uganda due to the shortage of Neurologists
    in the country. Plans are being developed for STH Epilepsy
    specialists to join SHSC &nbsp;staff on a future visit to
    Gulu –to enhance the local capacity for effective
    treatment</p>


    <p><b>Sheffield Children’s Hospital</b> (SCH) provides the
    Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in
    the city and as such provides valuable programmes to
    Commonwealth Fellows.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> both elements of the
    partnership with the other NHS Trusts in Sheffield provide
    unique knowledge, skills and experience as SHSC does not
    work in these fields.</p>

    <p><strong>Sheffield Health
        International Partnerships</strong> (SHIP) is the charity being created by Sheffield
    based members of the partnership to ensure long term
    sustainability using charitable status to fundraise for the
    partnership.</p>


    <p><strong>Health Uganda
        Group</strong> (HUG) allows members of
    the local Diaspora to provide Ugandan perspectives to the
    partnership and support to African visitors</p>

    <p><strong>University of
        Sheffield Clinical Psychology Unit, Department of
        Psychology</strong>&nbsp;provides the
    Sheffield-Gulu partnership with monitoring and evaluation
    expertise.</p>


    <p><strong>The Commonwealth
        Fellowship Programme</strong>. The programme
    is administered by the British Council and Association of
    Commonwealth Universities and funded by the Department for
    International Development. &nbsp;This programme finances
    Gulu mental health staff to visit Sheffield for observation
    and learning purposes</p>

    <p><b><u>Associated
    Links:</u></b></p>

    <p>SHSC ensures that it
    links with other relevant mental health partnerships in
    Uganda and the UK:</p>

    <ol start="1">
        <li>East
        London Foundation Trust- which has developed a link
        with Butabika Hospital (the only dedicated Psychiatric
        Hospital in Uganda) over approximately 7 years. Thanks
        to East London for funding the visit to Uganda in 2012
        which helped establish the Gulu link</li>

        <li>Heartsounds Service
        User Group in Kampala. Heartsounds is an innovative
        service user group which provides an Internet cafe,
        Drop In, Peer Support Services both in the community
        in-reaching into Butabika Hospital. Butabika Hospital
        is the only dedicated Mental Health Hospital in Uganda
        and as such is both the National Referral Centre and
        the training hub for qualified workers</li>

    <h4>4. Sheffield Gulu
        Mental Health Partnership: The Work.</h4>
    <h4>Year 1 Outcomes: October 2012- September
    2013</h4>


    <ul>
        <li>Mission Statement and Principles
        agreed with Mental Health Ward Management team. This will guide the
        work of the Partnership &nbsp;</li>

        <li>The charity created largely by SHSC
        staff, the Sheffield Health International Partnerships (SHIP) is
        registered for Gift Aid with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and is
        receiving donations.</li>

        <li>Gulu Gifts is raising approximately
        £1500 with targeted funding requests from Trust donors and general
        donations. This income will partly support the development of
        livelihood projects by Mental Health Uganda (MHU), the service user
        group in Gulu</li>

        <li>Bicycles have been donated to MHU
        thereby increasing their capacity to support people with mental health
        problems in the Gulu area.</li>

        <li>An Evaluation Framework was agreed
        with Sheffield University, which will measure both the experiences of
        Commonwealth Fellows and SHSC visiting Gulu. The Continuous
        Professional Development model is being used to capture staff learning
        which will identify the benefits to both GRRH and SHSC.</li>

        <li>Kim Parker (Senior Nurse and
        Partnership Clinical Lead) visited Gulu with Noelle Riggott, (Lead
        Occupational Therapist Adult Mental Health) in February 2013. An Acute
        Illness Management (AIM) course was delivered in partnership with
        University Hospital of South Manchester (UHSM) staff. The AIM course is
        the start of a programme that will lead to safer physical observations
        of patients and IV practice. UHSM returned on behalf of SHSC to deliver
        a half day refresher session in April. Medical equipment, paid for with
        donations from SHSC staff were also delivered.</li>

        <li>Greg Harrison Planning Manager and
        Partnership Coordinator) led a team in June 2013 which included the
        SHSC Infection Control Nurse (recruited for her general nursing
        background) and a RESPECT trainer. This trip delivered Mental Health
        Awareness training to MHU members and unqualified members of the Mental
        Health Unit; scoping for RESPECT Training to be delivered in November
        2013; and support for the implementation of the work initiated on both
        Handovers (in the Commonwealth Fellowship visit in 2012) and on the AIM
        training in February. &nbsp;All three major Objectives were
        achieved.</li>

        <li>Occupational Therapy is now
        established in the Mental Health Ward where previously there was none.
        This is now operating in two rooms on the Ward and User Volunteers
        support the day to day running of the OT service. This development
        occurred due to the SHSC visit to Gulu, the Commonwealth Fellowship
        visit in 2012</li>

        <li>The Handover Project which was
        identified as a need by Sister Immaculate Akello, a Commonwealth Fellow
        in 2012 has been adopted not only on the Mental Health Ward but, it is
        reported, throughout GRRH.</li>

        <li>Mental Health Awareness courses were
        delivered to both MHU members and a group of Gulu Regional Referral
        Hospital staff. Both courses have been adopted as work to be continued
        into Year 2.</li>

        <li>Taps were installed adjacent to the
        Mental Health Ward with Sheffield and Gulu Rotary Club involvement.
        This work was funded by a donation from a Trust Non- Executive
        Director, funding from UNISON and another private donation from SHSC.
        These taps will enable patients to access &nbsp;water and allow
        Attendants (family members who cook for their relatives) to prepare
        meals in the area of the Ward.</li>

        <li>The BMA Information Fund allocated
        £1700 worth of Medical books to GRRH and SHSC staff have transported
        them to Gulu in successive trips. There is an intention to use these
        books as a foundation of a Medical Library for GRRH.</li>

        <li>The Trust hosted three Commonwealth
        Fellows from the Mental Health Ward in GRRH for eight weeks from June
        to September 2013 as part of an ongoing programme. One of the Fellows
        is now the Mental Health Ward Manager and is being Skype- Mentored by
        the Partnership Clinical Lead and Coordinator.</li>

        <li>Funding for the Trusts work for the
        Sheffield Gulu Mental Health Partnership in Year 1 was through income
        from the British Council via its Commonwealth Fellowship
        Programme.</li>

        <li>A newsletter – Ujamaa- regularly
        informs Trust staff about progress with the Partnership</li>

        <li>A network of partners has been
        created that enables the Partnership to be effective</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>5. Sheffield Gulu
        Mental Health Partnership: The Work.</h4>
    <h4>Planned Outcomes Year 2 Strategic Plan:
    October 2013 - September 2014</h4>


    <ul>
        <li>Two Commonwealth Fellows are
        currently in Sheffield and a further five Gulu staff are being proposed
        by the GRRH Director with SHSC support for 2014. Four of the nominees
        will be Clinical staff and the fifth will research appropriate Medical
        Library systems for GRRH, in order to support the proposed Medical
        Library. The income from Hosting and Short Course Fee’s will finance
        SHSC visits to Gulu in 2014.</li>

        <li>The Commonwealth Fellowship
        Programme in 2013 has resulted in several Project Plans being
        identified for Gulu staff to implement. These include: a new Management
        &amp; Leadership model; a Training Programme for all staff (which will
        determine the clinical input from SHSC), a data collection system for
        the Mental Health Ward; and an Infection Control regime that is
        appropriate for the context. SHSC will support the development and
        implementation of these initiatives.</li>

        <li>Support the implementation of the
        Acute Illness Management work and physical observations of patients who
        have received medication.</li>

        <li>Identify Malaria Nets &amp; Bedding
        Sets for patients using local sources.</li>

        <li>Receive the Bill of Quantities from
        the Water Engineer for the Refurbishment of Ward building and explore
        options for supporting its redevelopment, in partnership with GRRH and
        the Rotary Clubs in Sheffield and Gulu, SHIP and other potential
        funders.</li>

        <li>An application has been submitted to
        the BMA Information Fund for a second allocation of medical textbooks
        for GRRH. If successful these books will be transported by SHSC and
        UHSM staff. SHSC has suggested mental health texts that will hopefully
        be included in the next round of funding.</li>

        <li>Kim Parker will lead an SHSC team of
        five staff to Gulu in November 2013. This trip will focus on delivering
        two RESPECT training courses to the entire staff team on the mental
        health ward at GRRH. It will also deliver Training the Trainers and
        Mental Health Awareness courses to selected MHU members, who will then
        deliver this in the Gulu region.</li>

        <li>Three visits to Gulu are planned in
        2014 and the aims of these trips will be negotiated with the new
        Management personnel on the Ward in November 2013</li>

        <li>An SHSC Policy for Volunteering in
        Low Income Countries will be presented to EDG in order to ensure that
        work in Uganda is established within the Trust’s Governance
        structure</li>

        <li>Mental Health Uganda will be
        supported to deliver a Mental Health Awareness Training the Trainers
        course. This will enable 12 MHU members to deliver this training in the
        Gulu region. They are being supported by SHSC to apply for finance to
        implement this training programme to a Finnish service user funding
        agency</li>

        <li>MHU are also being supported to
        develop their capacity building skills particularly with the Pass a
        Goat scheme. Gulu Gifts will fund the purchase of a herd of goats which
        will be self -sustaining and managed by MHU members</li>

        <li>Fundraising through SHIP will allow
        funding to be available through a variety of means</li>

        <li>The Payroll Giving Scheme for SHSC
        staff will be presented to the Executive Directors Group. This income
        will complement the other sources of finance for the
        Partnership</li>

        <li>Connect the Football Coaching needs
        of Gulu with skills that currently exist within SHSC and other
        organizations</li>

        <li>Support GRRH Management to address
        the issue of the disposal of clinical waste, burning rubbish tip by the
        Mental Health Ward and the inadequate Incinerator.</li>

        <li>Aim for each edition of the Ujamaa
        newsletter to be a joint production between Sheffield and Gulu, with
        approximately equal copy input.</li>

        <li>Establish a Partnership Operational
        Group, which will coordinate the work of the link in terms of
        fundraising, communication and Commonwealth Fellowship support. A
        Register of Skills and Interests form is being used to structure staff
        contributions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>6. The Work</h4>

    <p>The Partnership is pursuing work as
    described in the Strategic Plan – which is regularly updated by partners.
    This has several elements:</p>

    <ol start="1">
        <li>The initial 3 year phase of
        the Plan prioritises Patient Safety as the central element of the work.
        Patient Safety is also a current priority of Gulu Regional Referral
        Hospital (GRRH) and SHSC is working with GRRH to address this
        by:</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>Supporting the development
        of an Occupational Therapy service on the Mental Health Ward at
        GRRH</li>

        <li>Providing training in the
        prevention and management of violence and aggression (RESPECT –which is
        the SHSC preferred technique and is widely used in the UK) to Ward
        staff. This has been requested by Gulu staff</li>

        <li>Addressing the reliance on
        psychiatric Medication, and the unsafe administration techniques, as
        the main vehicle for treatment. This &nbsp;is being addressed by
        providing training in safe medication treatments and alternatives to
        the use of drugs</li>

        <li>Developing an appropriate
        information system on the ward which will enable monitoring and
        evaluation to be undertaken</li>

        <li>Brokering the provision of
        capital investment in the infrastructure of the Ward building from the
        Rotary Clubs in Sheffield and Gulu &nbsp;</li>

        <li>Working with Mental Health
        Uganda (MHU) in Gulu. This work involves:</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>Mental Health Awareness
        training- that enables MHU members to provide more structured support
        to others. This training has been piloted in Sheffield using Health
        Uganda Group members to provide culturally appropriate amendments. MHU
        members are being taught, by SHSC, to deliver Mental Health Awareness
        training in the Gulu area and this is being evaluated by Sheffield
        University.</li>

        <li>Capacity building by funding
        bicycles for the group to enable an expansion of their support work.
        This was achieved by a donation of US$1000 from the Board of SHSC.
        Governance arrangements identify accountability and maintenance
        measures are in place.</li>

        <li>Investment in livelihood
        projects that enables MHU members (all of whom have/ currently are
        experiencing mental health problems) to undertake income generation
        projects thereby reducing the pressures on their mental health. SHSC
        staff contributions are funding the purchase of a herd of goats for
        MHU, which will be donated to members of the group in most need. The
        offspring of these goats will be handed onto other members of the
        group, and this self- sustaining process will continue- entirely
        managed by MHU. This will provide modest income generation and a focus
        for daily living for those with mental health problems in the
        community. Project planning support for the implementation of this
        scheme is provided by SHSC</li>
