    <h2>Sixty is the new forty...</h2>
    <p class='lead text-right'>
      ...so please sponsor me to walk up Ben Nevis, Scafell and Snowdon in 24 hours -for the borehole in Gulu
    </p>
    <p>
      I am convinced that 60 is the new 40 so in my sixtieth year I am walking up Ben Nevis, Scafell and Snowdon in 24 hours to raise money for the borehole appeal at the mental health unit in Gulu Hospital.
      These are the three highest peaks in Scotland, England & Wales respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are well over halfway to raising the money needed to build the borehole, and when the supply is connected it will make such a difference to patients and staff – who currently do not have any regular water. As you will have heard us say before the lack of water is a fundamental problem that affects so many things.
    </p>
    <p>
      My 27 year old son is walking with me – so if needed he can carry me. We are undertaking this walk with other friends on Saturday 27th June into Sunday 28th.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might be a bit tired at work on June 29th!
