    <h2>About the Sheffield Health International Partnerships (SHIP)</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      SHIP is a group of Sheffield health workers who are working with partners in Uganda. SHIP currently is comprised of two local organisations: Sheffield Medical Group - a Primary and Secondary Care partnership linked with Kumi, Eastern Uganda and the Sheffield Health and Social care NHS Trust - a Mental Health Partnership with Gulu in the North of Uganda. The two elements of SHIP work independently of each other but are closely linked and share a common philosophical approach to partnerships and to working in low income countries.

      SHIP currently works in Uganda but may develop health links in other low income countries in future.

      Mutual learning is at the heart of SHIP both in Uganda and in Sheffield - reflecting 
the spirit of partnership.
