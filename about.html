      Sheffield Health International Partnerships (SHIP) is a group of Sheffield health workers who are working with partners in Uganda. SHIP currently is comprised of two local organisations: Sheffield Medical Group - a Primary and Secondary Care partnership linked with Kumi, Eastern Uganda and the Sheffield Health and Social care NHS Trust - a Mental Health Partnership with Gulu in the North of Uganda. The two elements of SHIP work independently of each other but are closely linked and share a common philosophical approach to partnerships and to working in low income countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHIP currently works in Uganda but may develop health links in other low income countries in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutual learning is at the heart of SHIP both in Uganda and in Sheffield - reflecting 
the spirit of partnership.
